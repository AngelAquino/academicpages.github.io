collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-sukatwika.md
excerpt: 'There is a lack of understanding on the qualities of texts that children can read, especially in Philippine languages. Text quality should be informed by an analysis of text difficulty, which can be measured by the linguistic properties of text such as word density, concept load, and phonological weight. The SukatWika analysis tool was developed to automate the extraction of this information for texts written in Filipino, English, Sinugbuanong Binisaya, and Ilokano languages. The results obtained from this software can be used as an aid in the creation of instructional materials which will support reading development among learners.'
