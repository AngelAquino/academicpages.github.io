I'm a master's student at the University of the Philippines working on speech and language processing for Philippine languages. I also teach undergraduate courses at the UP Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute, and co-advise student research projects under the UP Digital Signal Processing Laboratory.

Research interests
------
- syntactic and semantic representations
- machine translation
- natural language understanding
- speech recognition and synthesis
- low-resource technology
- Philippine languages

Other interests
------
- music (here are some of my favorite [choral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-mincZQozE), [classical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_1N6_O254g), and [prog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n7uvokARQ4) performances)
- video games (the most influential on me personally were Civ II, Portal 2, Ace Attorney, and Professor Layton)
- cooking (admittedly not very good at it yet; would love to hear about more grad-student-friendly recipes!)
- photography (am especially fond of [sunrises](https://photos.app.goo.gl/xwvhTsobmtjetQfV6), [sunsets](https://photos.app.goo.gl/xwvhTsobmtjetQfV6), and [candid](https://photos.app.goo.gl/DDxDyr6y325H9Cu4A) [animal](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZELiLwcHdMxerZq98) [photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/6szixSKFxjx8NRyL8))
